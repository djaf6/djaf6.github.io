## What is Club Finder Manoa?

Club Finder Manoa is an application to help students find clubs at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. UH Manoa has over 200 registered independent organizations and clubs. A lot of those clubs are not official UHM clubs or active organizations. There is no database for students to access the entire list of clubs, what they do, and how to join. Our application will provide a centralized directory for University of Hawaii at Manoa student clubs. Students are able to login and browse through our directory and find the exact club they are looking for. Each club will show a brief description, meeting times and locations, and contact information for lead club members.
