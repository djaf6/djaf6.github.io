<p><em>Javascript: Learning the worldâ€™s most popular programming language</em></p>

<p>As a Computer Engineering major, the programming language that we are taught from the beginning are C and C++. Coming into my first Computer Science course where the main programming language is Javascript; I had to adapt pretty quickly. Despite the disadvantage, I am excited to become proficient in multiple programming languages.</p>

<h2 id="javascript">Javascript</h2>

<p>Javascript is the most popular programming language because it is a high-level programming language. As far as Javascript being a good programming language from a software engineering perspective, there are a few advantages and disadvantages. The biggest advantage is that Javascript runs really fast on a web browser, which is why most companies such as, Google, uses it. It is also easy to learn and is versatile. Some disadvantages are that code is easily visible to everyone which is not ideal on a cybersecurity perspective. After doing the FreeCodeCamp, I already gained a respect for the language and prefer it over C/C++. The concepts and structure of the language is easier for me to understand.</p>

<h2 id="athletic-software-engineering">Athletic Software Engineering</h2>

<p>This is the first time I am participating in a course that uses Athletic Software Engineering. The practice WODs are useful because it gives us a taste of how the problems will be during the real WOD in class. Personally, I am not fond of this style of learning because I am not used to programming under pressure, especially with short time constraints. However, I think that I can benefit from this learning style because there is no room for being lazy and make shortcuts in learning the content. Is it stressful? Very. I feel like this class will keep me up at night.</p>

<h2 id="bye-for-now">Bye For Now</h2>

<p>All in all, I am very excited to learn more Javascript through Athletic Software Engineering. I am ready for the late nights and preparing for the WODs every Thursday.</p>
