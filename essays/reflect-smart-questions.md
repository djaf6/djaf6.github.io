## Smart Questions in Engineering

Smart questions are important for smart software engineers because it is a more efficient way to solve complex problems and comprehend new concepts. If there is an issue, asking stupid questions will take longer to get to a solution. It is faster to sit and think what you are really asking for then formatting the question in a way that the person answering does not need to ask for more clarification. It is also important that you make sure that your question has not already been answered on Google or a forum website. It is important to do your own research before asking for help. You will just look lazy if you ask a question that has an answer that is easily accessible online. Asking a smart question also requires every detail of the issue and what you are actually trying to accomplish. You are never going to get the solution that you are looking for just by saying, "My program isn't compiling. Help!". See below for an example of a smart question and a not-so-smart one.
