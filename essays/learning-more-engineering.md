***Adding To My Engineering Brain***

I walked into this class with some coding experience in languages such as C and C++ not knowing that the main languages that were taught in this class were Javascript and HTML/CSS. Me being me, I instantly panic and feel so far behind. But with the educational technique called athletic software engineering, it helped me get up to speed. There were a few topics that I learned about this semester that interested me:

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>User Interface Frameworks</li>
    <li>Agile Project Management</li>
    <li>Ethics in Software Engineering</li>
  <ul>
    </div>

**User Interface Frameworks**

The user interface framework is a set of classes and interfaces that define elements to help create a stylized and professional looking website or application. Most UI's provide a structured code for components such as align elements, tables, grids, and color schemes. The UI that I enjoyed using was Bootstrap 5 because the documentation of the code was easy to navigate and understand.
