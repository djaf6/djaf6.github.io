*From Nursing to Computer Engineering: Becoming a Software Engineer.*

When I entered the University of Hawaii at Manoa, I was a pre-nursing major. My hopes and dreams were to become a registered nurse in either Labor and Delivery or Pediatrics. Although nursing is a highly respectable major, my heart was not completely in it. After my second semester as a nursing major, I started seeking for a new path. Eventually, I decided on Computer Engineering. Why would I go from one hard major to another hard major? Truthfully, I changed my major from Nursing to Computer Engineering because I felt like I would still be making my parents happy even though I was not pursuing the traditional Filipino dream of becoming a Nurse. I had no experience in programming whatsoever, or any interest in the matter.

I am now in my last semester of my journey to receive my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering. I can say that I have a few intersests in Graphic and Web Design and Cybersecurity. I currently have my own freelance photography business and I hope to be able to program my own website one day. My interest in cybersecurity is a new one that grew from working on a capstone project for SCADA systems. 

Although I am graduating this semester, I am no where near the level of engineer I strive to be. I hope that I can perfect my programming skills to where I can code like it is muscle memory. Hopefully, in a couple years I will be working for a big software company.

The little freshman nursing student would have never believed that she will be graduating with a BS in Computer Engineering in a few months. She was scared to disappoint her parents and be a failure. But I think she is far from that.
