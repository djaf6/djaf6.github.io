# Want to code quicker? Use a design pattern!
Design patterns are very useful when coding something on the fly. A design pattern is a template that provides tested and proven development model. You basically take code that is similar to what you are trying to develop and change it up to fit your needs. There are used to solve common probelms when designing software. The reason why design patterns are useful is that most of the time, freshly written code has bugs or issues in them that has not been fixed. When using design patterns, as long as you do not change the key parts of the code, it is more reliable than new code. Using design patterns are also useful for beginner developers because it allows them to get familiar with code that follows coding rules. It allows them to learn software design in an easier and faster way. There are three different categories of design patterns: creational, structural, and behaviorial as shown in the image below.

# I will use a design pattern!!
During the last few weeks in this semester, we used the Bowfolios template for multiple class assignments and our final project. It was very easy to implement the details we needed to complete those assignments. It was especially helpful when we were using the Bowfolios design patterns for our final project. We are creating a club finder app called Club Finder Manoa. We cloned the Bowfolios template and changed details from that code to implement certain pages we needed for our project. Making new pages was also fairly simple because we just had to copy code from one page and create a new one with the adjustments to make the page we need. I feel like if we did not have the Bowfolios design patterns, we would have not finished as much of the project as we did.
